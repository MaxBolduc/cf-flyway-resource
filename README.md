# cf-flyway-resource

## Image description

A custom concourse-ci resource type built from [boxfuse/flyway](https://hub.docker.com/r/boxfuse/flyway). The image comes with the `cf_cli` and `jq` installed.

The image can already be used for task scripting.

## Development in progress

The resource out script will allows flyway migration automation directly from a concourse pipeline.
